🧠 What is Caesar Cipher?
    
    The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and most well-known encryption techniques. Each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.
    
    For example, with a shift of 3:
    
    A → D
    B → E
    ...
    X → A
    Y → B
    Z → C


🚀 How to Use

🔧 Prerequisites
      Python 3 installed on your system
      ▶️ Running the Program
      Clone this repo:
      git clone https://github.com/NightCrawler9924/CaesarCipher.git
      cd CaesarCipher
      Run the script:
      python Encryption.py
      Follow the on-screen prompts to:
      Choose encryption or decryption
      Enter the file name (e.g., abc.txt)
      Input the shift key (e.g., 3)
      Encrypted and decrypted files will be saved as encrypted.txt and decrypted.txt respectively.

🧪 Example

    Input (abc.txt): HELLO WORLD
    Encrypted (with shift 3): KHOOR ZRUOG
    Decrypted: HELLO WORLD
